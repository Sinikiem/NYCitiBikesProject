# NYCitiBikesProject
This project helps identify key trends and user behaviors in the NY Citi Bike rental data. The visualizations and insights gathered can help optimize services for different user types and age groups.

This project provides an analysis of NY Citi Bike rentals using an Excel dataset. The analysis answers key questions regarding bike rental patterns across age groups, popular pick-up locations, and user types. The project also explores how bike trip durations vary across different age groups and whether there's a relationship between age and trip duration.

Key Questions Analyzed:
1. What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for NY Citi Bike rental?
The data is visualized to highlight the most common starting locations for bike rentals.
2. How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
Age groups are compared to see how long each group typically rides bikes.
3. Which age group rents the most bikes?
A breakdown of the number of bikes rented per age group is provided to understand the most frequent renters.
4. How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
The data explores the differences in bike usage between one-time users and subscribers based on weekday patterns.
5. Does user age impact the average bike trip duration?
A scatter plot was used to check for correlations between age and trip duration, revealing that there is no strong correlation between these two variables.

Data Visualization
The project uses several types of visualizations including:
- Bar charts for most popular pick-up locations.
- Bar charts comparing bike rentals across age groups.
- Line charts showcasing bike rental trends for subscribers vs. one-time users.
- A scatter plot to visualize the relationship between user age and average trip duration.
  
Insights and Findings
- Popular Pick-up Locations: The most frequently used stations are located in high-traffic areas such as Grove St PATH and Exchange Place.
- Age and Trip Duration: Although the 75+ age group has a significantly higher average trip duration compared to younger groups, the overall trend does not indicate a consistent relationship between age and duration for the majority of riders.
- Bike Rentals by Age Group: The 35-44 age group rents the most bikes, followed by the 25-34 group.
- User Type Patterns: Long-term subscribers tend to rent bikes consistently throughout the week, while one-time users are more likely to rent during weekends.
